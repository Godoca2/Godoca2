Hi! I'm César 👋 
Data Engineer with more than a decade of experience, specialised in data management and analysis, my work focuses on ensuring the efficient, secure operation of technological systems, providing crucial support to the technical team and optimising the performance of the organisation.

My work ranges from process automation and quality control to the implementation of geographic information systems (GIS) and databases.

I use tools such as database systems, high-level programming languages and Business Intelligence platforms. I am proficient in Machine Learning techniques to develop predictive and segmentation models, managing both structured and unstructured data.

My commitment to innovation and continuous learning is reflected in my academic and professional career, currently pursuing a Master in Data Science to evolve into a Data Scientist role. In addition, I have experience in aerial photogrammetry and in the creation of digital models for various industrial sectors (DGAC Certified Operator).

My goal is to continue developing disruptive and collaborative solutions that enhance the efficient use of technological resources, benefiting all the technical areas of the company and contributing to a sustainable future 🌱
