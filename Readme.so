Hi I'm César 👋 

## Data Engineer with more than a decade of experience, specialised in data management and analysis, my work focuses on ensuring the efficient and secure operation of technological systems, providing crucial support to the technical team and optimising the performance of the organisation.

## My work ranges from process automation and quality control to the implementation of geographic information systems (GIS) and databases.

I use tools such as database systems, high-level programming languages and business intelligence platforms. I am proficient in Machine Learning techniques to develop predictive and segmentation models, managing structured and unstructured data.

Currently pursuing a Master in Data Science to evolve towards a Data Scientist role at the University of Development.
